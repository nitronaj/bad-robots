This is a modern take on the classic [BSD robots](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=robots&apropos=0&sektion=6) game that was quite popular in the '90s.

How to play: 

Move the cow around to make the robots crash into one another.
Teleport: Randomly move the cow. Use with caution as the cow may land on one of the robots.
Safe Teleport: Earn it by using the 'catch me if you can' feature.
Catch me if you can: Stay still and let the robots come to you. If you are successful you'll earn one 'safe teleport' token.
